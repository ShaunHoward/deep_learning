Logits simply means that the function operates on the unscaled output of earlier layers and that
 the relative scale to understand the units is linear. It means, in particular, the sum of the
 inputs may not equal 1, that the values are not probabilities (you might have an input of 5).

tf.nn.softmax produces just the result of applying the softmax function to an input tensor. The
 softmax "squishes" the inputs so that sum(input) = 1; it's a way of normalizing. The shape of
 output of a softmax is the same as the input - it just normalizes the values. The outputs of
 softmax can be interpreted as probabilities.

a = tf.constant(np.array([[.1, .3, .5, .9]]))
print s.run(tf.nn.softmax(a))
[[ 0.16838508  0.205666    0.25120102  0.37474789]]

In contrast, tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits computes the cross entropy of the result
 after applying the softmax function (but it does it all together in a more mathematically careful
 way). It's similar to the result of:

sm = tf.nn.softmax(x)
ce = cross_entropy(sm)

The cross entropy is a summary metric - it sums across the elements. The output of
 tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits on a shape [2,5] tensor is of shape [2,1] (the first
 dimension is treated as the batch).

In order to do optimization to minimize the cross entropy, AND use softmax after the
 last layer, tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits should be used
 because it covers numerically unstable corner cases in the mathematically correct way. Otherwise,
 it'll end up being hacked together by adding little epsilons here and there.

"""Builds the MNIST network.
Implements the inference/loss/training pattern for model building.
1. inference() - Builds the model as far as is required for running the network
forward to make predictions.
2. loss() - Adds to the inference model the layers required to generate loss.
3. training() - Adds to the loss model the Ops required to generate and
apply gradients.
